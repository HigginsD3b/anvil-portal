# Preliminary Steps

>Make any changes to the [AnVIL Data Submitters - Preliminary steps - Markdown]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzRCnDXSQ0-RRTUX9jjTaNchQXppx6Tely-MN_-aueI/edit) Google doc.


After your dataset has been approved by the AnVIL data ingestion committee, you will need to coordinate with the AnVIL data ingest team and provide information on your dataset to help set up your data workspace on the AnVIL. Because it’s extremely useful to get familiar with the platform, we’ve included a selection of reading and video tutorials.



## Review AnVIL training
- For a video introduction to Terra, see [Terra Videos](/learn/videos/terra-videos).
- For an overview of the AnVIL platform and key concepts, see [Getting Started with AnVIL](/learn) and the [Workshop Archive](/learn/workshop-archive).
>Please contact the AnVIL Outreach team with support and training requests at <help@lists.anvilproject.org>



## 1 -  Coordinate with the AnVIL Data Ingest team
- Email <anvil-data@broadinstitute.org> to arrange an AnVIL kickoff meeting

### Data Requirements

>Note: All submitted genomic data should be based on Human reference genome assembly GRCh37 or GRCh38.

> When submitting data to the AnVIL, please ensure your study has been registered in dbGaP. You will need to populate the data elements `dbGaP_study_ID` (phsXXXXXX).

>All data must conform to the [NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Policies-Guidance/Genomic-Data-Sharing).



- [Register for a Terra Account](/learn/account-setup/creating-a-terra-account) if you do not have one already.

>While there are no charges for uploading and storing your data in AnVIL, in order to complete an analysis, you will need to connect a Google Billing Account to your Terra account. See [Overview of Billing Concepts](/learn/billing-setup/billing-concepts) and [Creating a Google Cloud Billing Account](/learn/billing-setup/creating-a-google-cloud-billing-account) for more information.



## 2 - Complete the AnVIL data submission form
The form gathers study information needed to create the deposit workspace. **To complete the form, you will need**    
dbGaP registration ID (phsID)    
Consent groups
Consent codes
Types of data (i.e., genomic, phenotypic, etc.)
- Number of samples
- Submitter information (emails of all people who need access to the deposit workspace)

>Please contact your program officer and the NHGRI Genomic Program Administrator for assistance and/or questions about dbGaP registration and/or consent groups.
