# Getting Started with AnVIL

  <!--- Add links! --->

The AnVIL platform is an [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL) supported data commons running on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). AnVIL enables researchers to analyze high-value open and controlled access genomic [datasets](/data) with popular analysis tools in a [secure](/overview/security) cloud computing environment.

AnVIL uses [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) as its analysis platform, [Gen3](https://gen3.theanvil.io) for data search and artificial cohort creation, and [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/) as a repository for Docker-based genomic analysis tools and workflows.

In addition to Docker-based analysis workflows,  AnVIL supports popular interactive analysis tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Bioconductor, RStudio, and [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/).

By operating in the cloud, AnVIL users can scale analyses from a single computer to thousands of cores and securely share data, workflows, and reproducible results with collaborators and colleagues.

### About AnVIL’s Documentation
AnVIL’s training materials curate, organize, and augment existing component and tool documentation, and show how to use AnVIL’s parts together to accomplish the goals of AnVIL’s different user personas.

The AnVIL team is in the process of developing persona-specific guides and tutorials for data analysts, [principal investigators](/learn/principal-investigators/setting-up-lab-accounts), developers, instructors, and [data contributors](/learn/consortia/data-submission).

<hero>  For a full list of AnVIL guides and tutorials for each persona, see [Guides and Tutorials](/learn/guides-and-tutorials). </hero>

## New User Onboarding Guide

The following is a guided walk-through of the  AnVIL / Terra documentation with a focus on onboarding and preparing new users to run genomic analyses in the cloud.

This section covers:

1. Setting up and linking user accounts.
1. Obtaining access to controlled-access data.
1. An overview of workspaces.
1. An overview of billing setup.

### Account Setup

All you need is a Google account to register with Terra and browse AnVIL’s publicly accessible workspaces.

Likewise, with a Google account, you can register with Gen3 and browse publicly accessible datasets or register with Dockstore and browse tools and workflows.

To send artificial cohorts from Gen3 to Terra, you will need to link your Gen3 and Terra accounts.

To allow your dbGaP data request approvals to flow through to Terra and Gen3,  you will need to link your eRA commons ID with both platforms.


<hero> For instructions on setting up accounts in Google, Terra, Gen3, and linking them together see  [Account Setup](/learn/account-setup).</hero>

### Discovering and Accessing Data

AnVIL holds genomic data for hundreds of thousands of study participants. Much of this data is controlled-access.

To obtain access to controlled-access data sets, you must either be a member of a data-generating consortia with a data-sharing agreement among consortia members or have been granted access to a study through the dbGapP Data Access Request process.


Once you have been granted access, and assuming you have linked your eRA commons ID with Terra and Gen3, you will be able to see your new studies in Gen3 and new data-oriented workspaces in Terra.

AnVIL’s open-access datasets such as [1000 Genomes High Coverage 2019](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/1000G-high-coverage-2019) can be accessed in Terra or Gen3 immediately after account creation.

For a detailed listing of available datasets searchable by disease, data type, consent type and consortia, see AnVIL’s  [Dataset Catalog](/data).

<hero> For instructions on requesting data access see [Requesting Data Access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access) and [Discovering Data](learn/accessing-data/discovering-data).</hero>

### Overview of Terra Workspaces

In Terra, workspaces are used to configure, run, and share analyses and results. Terra workspaces typically hold genomic data along with subject-level phenotypic data and are configured with analysis tools such as notebooks and Docker images. Workspaces can also hold the output generated by running an analysis.

A workspace consists of:

1. A **Dashboard** - for holding markdown documentation about the workspace..
1. A **Cloud Storage Bucket** for holding data files, notebooks, and analysis output. Typically this bucket is configured as “requester pays” meaning that users downloading from the buicket pay cloud egress fees.
1. **Data Tables** -  for holding participant or sequencing metadata.
1. **Reference Data** - links to a genome or other reference data such as hg38.
1. **Workspace Data** - Additional key-value data pairs used for configuring the workspace.

Workspace configuration controls who can view, clone, launch, or share a workspace and whose Google Cloud Billing Account is charged for any GCP cloud compute costs incurred by workspace.



### Workspace Flavors

Workspaces come in several general types or flavors:

**Data Oriented Workspaces** - These workspaces hold the primary data for AnVIL studies. They The open or controlled access datasets you have access to are available in Terra workspaces viewable on the “My Workspaces” tab of your “Workspaces” list.

### Workspaces and Billing


TODO:

AnVIL and all of its components are free to use, however, as  Terra runs on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), certain workspace activities, such as running an analysis,  storing analysis results, or downloading data may incur Google Cloud Platform (GCP) fees.


When a workspace is created either from scratch or by cloning another workspace, the workspace is linked to a Terra Billing Project.

Terra Billing Projects are in turn,  linked with a single Google Cloud Billing Account. Through this mechanism, the costs associated with the workspace are passed through to the specified Google Cloud Billing Account.

Performing the following workspace activities will incur costs on GCP that will be passed through to the workspace’s Terra Billing Project’s Google Cloud Billing Account:

1. Uploading data to the workspace bucket - the upload network transfer or ingress is free however there will be a CGP fee for storing the data in the bucket over time.

1. Writing a Jupyter Notebook  - Notebooks are stored in the workspaces bucket. Uploading the notebook is free. There will be storage charges for the notebook.

1. “Launching a Cloud Environment” - This term is used to indicate the  launching of a single machine or cluster to run a notebook or workflow. The charges will depend on the type of machine and number of processors selected as well as any disk or ram space used. This is also referred to as “Launching a Workspace”


1. Storage for persistent disk associated with any paused cloud environments.
