# Getting Started with AnVIL


Through a combination of online courses, workshops, and course materials, content will be created using the [FAIR data principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and tailored to a variety of scenarios. Specific modules will be created for data consumers, data analysts, methods developers, and principal investigators.
## Account Setup
These Quick Start guides will help new AnVIL users get started as quickly as possible.
We’ve made sensible recommendations that will fit many (but not all)
situations, and have included notes and links for users
with more specialized situations.
