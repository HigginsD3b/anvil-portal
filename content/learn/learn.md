# Learning AnVIL

  <!--- Add links! --->

The AnVIL platform is an [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL) supported data commons running on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). AnVIL enables researchers to analyze high-value genomic datasets with popular analysis tools in a secure cloud computing environment.

AnVIL uses [Terra](/learn/videos/terra-videos) as its analysis platform, [Gen3](/learn/getting-started/getting-started-with-gen3) for data search and artificial cohort creation, and [Dockstore](/learn/videos/dockstore-videos) as a repository for Docker-based genomic analysis tools and workflows.

In addition to Docker-based batch execution analysis tools,  AnVIL supports popular interactive analysis tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Bioconductor, RStudio, and [Galaxy](/learn/getting-started/getting-started-with-galaxy).

By operating in the cloud, AnVIL users can scale analyses from a single computer to thousands of cores and securely share data, workflows, and reproducible results with collaborators and colleagues.

### About AnVIL’s Documentation
AnVIL’s training materials curate, organize, and augment existing component and tool documentation and provide original information about how to use the AnVIL platform’s parts together to accomplish the goals of AnVIL’s different user personas.

The AnVIL team is in the process of persona-specific guides and  tutorials for Data Analysts, [Principal Investigators](/learn/principal-investigators/setting-up-lab-accounts), Developers, Instructors, and [Data Contributors](/learn/consortia/data-submission).

For example,  Principal Investigators can see  [Setting Up Lab Accounts](/learn/for-pis/setting-up-lab-accounts) for information on how to set up lab members and lab billing accounts in Google Billing and Terra and the [Budget Templates Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HX4-3F-bLCwld_qsxOPd1OSHV403C0cYgVnT8tnpPJc) for instructions on calculating a budget and writing a budget justification for using AnVIL in grant applications.





  <!--- Add FAIR, add interoperability with other data commons, increased accessibility to complex data center--->

## Getting Started

### Account Setup

Anyone with a Google account can register with Terra and view Terra’s publicly accessible workspaces, [1000 Genomes High-Coverage](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/1000G-high-coverage-2019), for example.

Likewise, anyone with a Google account can register with Gen3 and view publicly accessible datasets or register with Dockstore and browse tools and workflows.

To access controlled access datasets in Gen3 or Terra, you must link eRA Commons ID to both Terra and Gen3, and link your Terra and Gen3 accounts to each other.  For instructions on setting up accounts in Google, Terra, Gen3, and linking them together see  [Account Setup](/learn/account-setup).

### About Terra Workspaces

Analysis in Terra is centered around the “workspace”. Terra workspaces typically hold genomic data along with subject-level phenotypic data and are configured with analysis tools such as notebooks and Docker images. Workspaces also hold the output or derived data generated by analyses.

Workspace configuration also controls who can view, clone, launch, or share a workspace and whose Google Billing Account is charged for any GCP cloud compute costs incurred by workspace. For additional informaton about Terra workspaces see [Understanding Workspaces](/learn/understanding-workspaces).




### About Cloud Costs

AnVIL and all of its components are free to use. Certain activities, however, such as creating or cloning a workspace,  downloading data, or running an analysis, may incur costs on behalf of the workspace owner for any CGP compute, storage, or egress utilized. For additional information on understanding and controlling cloud costs see [Understanding Cloud Costs](/learn/understanding-cloud-costs).


### Billing Setup


To run analysis on Terra you must either:

1. Have “Write, Can-Execute” permissions on a workspace created by a collaborator. Any charges incurred by launching the workspaces flow through to the Google Billing Account associated with the Terra Billing Project your collaborator associated with the workspace.



1. Be added as a user on a collaborator’s Terra Billing Project. This allows you to create or clone workspaces on your own. Any charges incurred by the workspaces you create flow through to the Google Billing Account associated with your collaborator’s Terra Billing Project.


1. Create your own Google Billing Account, and link it to a payment method and to Terra. This allows you to create your own Terra Billing Project and then use it to create or clone your own workspaces. Your Google Billing Account will be charged for any GCP fees incurred by launching or downloading data from the workspace.

### Setting Up Budgets and Alerts


Create a GCP Billing Account
Must specify a payment method.

Add Terra as a User - can create projects

Create a Terra Billing Project, this creates a google billing project for the Billing Account.

Once you have a Terra Billing Project you can use it to create workspaces that you can use or share. Give it to someone with write and cant share.

You can search for workspaces per billing project, so you can see them again later.




The Terra Billing Project is in turn associated with a Google Billing Account associated with the workspace owner.

To launch an existing workspace you must either be the workspace “Owner” or be a workspace “Writer” with “Can Execute” permissions.


To create or clone a workspace you must be associated with a Terra Billing Project.

To obtain access to a Terra Billing Project you will need to either set one up yourself or be added to one by your lab manager or principal investigator.

### Discovering and Accessing Data

AnVIL holds genomic data for hundreds of thousands of study participants. Much of this data is controlled access. To obtain access, you must either be a member of a data generating consortia that has a data-sharing agreement among consortia members or have been granted access through the dbGapP Data Access Request process.


A full listing of AnVIL’s datasets searchable by disease, data type, and consent type on our [Dataset Catalog](/data).

Cohorts created in Gen3 can be exported to Terra workspaces for analysis. Additionally, Terra data-centric workspaces can be cloned in Terra and then used in an analysis.

See [Requesting Data Access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access) and [Discovering Data](learn/accessing-data/discovering-data) for more information.
