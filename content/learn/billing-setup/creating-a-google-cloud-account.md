# Creating a Google Cloud Account

To set up GCP Billing for yourself or manage GCP Billing for someone else, you will need a Google Cloud account. Having a Google Cloud account will allow you to access Google Cloud resources and for others to invite you to manage their resources.

<hero>Note that you may not need a Google Cloud if someone else, e.g., a colleague, a lab, or cloud credits program, will be managing and paying for your compute costs.</hero>

>Check with your institutional procurement office for a preferred method to set up your Google Cloud Account, such as using a third-party reseller or an existing account

Once you have signed up with Google Cloud, you may be eligible for $300 in cloud credits. See [Google Cloud Free Program][https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier/#free-trial] to learn more.
