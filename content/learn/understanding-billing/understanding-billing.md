# Understanding Billing

AnVIL and all of its components are free to use. Terra is AnVILs analysis
platform and runs the Google Clout Platform (GCP).

You can browse showcase workspaces and the Data Library as soon as you register
for an account, however, compute operations in Terra - such as running
workflows,
running Jupyter Notebooks, and accessing and storing data - may incur Google Cloud Platform charges.

These charges are billed by GCP and paid through your Google Cloud Platform payment method.



- [Controlling cloud costs](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/sections/360006459511-Controlling-Cloud-costs) - Understand the costs of using key cloud services (Google Cloud Storage, Google Computer Engine, and Google BigQuery). Examples are provided to help you make informed decisions around controlling costs on Terra.
