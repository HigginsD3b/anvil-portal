# Account Setup

- [Set up a Terra account](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360028235911-How-to-register-for-a-Terra-account) - To register for a [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) account, you will need a Gmail account or another email account (an institutional email, for example) associated with a Google identity.

- [Set up Terra account with non-Google email](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611-Setting-up-a-Google-account-with-a-non-Google-email) - If your email is not associated with a Google identity, follow these steps to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address.

- [Set up a Gen3 account](https://gen3.theanvil.io/login) Create a Gen3 account by logging in with your NIH, Google, or RAS login credentials. This allows you to use the Gen3 data explorer to create artificial cohorts over AnVIL datasets that have been indexed by Gen3.

- [Link your Gen3 and Terra accounts](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360050390451) - Follow these step-by-step instructions to link your Gen3 credentials to your Terra account. This allows you to analyze Gen3 data on Terra.

- [Link your Terra and eRA Commons ID](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360038086332-Linking-Terra-to-External-Servers) - To use controlled-access data on Terra, you will need to link your Terra user ID to your authorization account (such as a dbGaP account). Linking to external servers will allow Terra to automatically determine if you can access controlled datasets hosted in Terra (ex. TCGA, TOPMed, etc.) based on your approved dbGaP applications. 

- [Link your Terra identity with Google Billing](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026182251-How-to-set-up-billing-projects-and-Google-Billing-Accounts) - The Terra platform is free to use; you can browse showcase workspaces and the Data Library as soon as you register for an account. However operations in Terra - such as running workflows, running Jupyter Notebooks, and accessing and storing data - may incur Google Cloud Platform charges. These charges are billed by GCP and paid through your Terra billing account.
