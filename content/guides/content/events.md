*An introduction to the AnVIL platform to enable CCDG and CMG researchers
to analyze GSP data using AnVIL tools. Participants will gain exposure and familiarity
with available data, tools, workflows, training materials, and support channels of AnVIL.
Participants will not become bioinformatic experts, but will know what to do
or who to contact when the time comes.*

### Background
A longer form background/rational for why this session is being provided. For example:

*In summer 2020, NHGRI plans to organize Massive Genome Informatics in the
Cloud or MaGIC, a two-day, jamboree-style informatics event for
introducing new users to the
AnVIL platform for cloud-based genomics data analysis.*

### Audience
A description of the target audience / qualifications for attending. Similar to: *No computational expertise is required.
Anyone from GSP who would like to learn about cloud based genomic analysis on AnVIL.
This Jamboree will focus on highlighting interactive tools that are used from a
graphical user interface.*
